# rrf3
Just a place to put some rrf3-stuff from my 3D printer and CNC Router projects.

The actual config.g is from a Duet Maestro Clone on an Ender 2 based Printer.
This printer runs a Mobius 3 Extruder and a LCD12864 Display with a rotary encoder.
Of course with RRF 3.x, also with M540 (so a set mac address) as that seems to make some problems
if you have more than one Duet Maestro in your network.
